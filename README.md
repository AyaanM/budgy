### What allowed for the success of this program

The thing that helped me keep track of whereabouts I was going with this program is that each time I was about to commit, I would write up what I have to do next time I sit down to code this program.

I also created a list of objectives which would be given the status of either "DONE" or "IN-PROGRESS." Objectives that had not yet been worked on remained blank.
